This repository contains basic instructions on how to use GitHub and Python noteboooks to facilitate learning.

## GitHub Setup & Workflow
The following guide will walk you through how to setup GitHub and GitHub basics:

1. Creating a GitHub account

2. Setting up SSH keys

3. Cloning repositories

4. Understanding branches

5. Making pull requests

## 1. Creating a GitHub Account

Go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and create a free personal account using your personal email.

*note: you can use your work email but likely won't be able to work on personal projects with this account. Better to just have one personal account, which is GitHub's official recommendation [see here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts).*

## 2. Generate SSH Keys

SSH keys are digital credentials used to authenticate and encrypt communication between systems using the SSH (Secure SHell) protocol. There are two components to an SSH key, a Public key and a Private key. There is an asymmetrical relationship between these two keys. The Public key CANNOT decrypt messages generated by the Private key and the Private key CAN decrypt messages generated by the Public key. Think of a Public key, not as a key, but as a 'padlock' that you can make copies of and put anywhere. A Private key, the actual key, can open this 'padlock' that is stored on another machine. To make this system work, you would copy the Public key as `authorized_keys` in the `~/.ssh` folder.

### 2.1 ssh-keygen

Open Git Bash and paste the below, replacing the email with your GitHub account email.
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
This will create a new SSH key. When prompted to enter a file to save the key, press **enter** to accept the default file location.

### 2.2 Passphrase

At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. **REMEMBER WHAT YOU TYPED**, you'll be asked to input this passphrase whenever you push to a repo.

### 2.3 Add SSH to ssh-agent

In Git Bash, paste the below, replacing *YOU* with your system user name.
```
ssh-add c:/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
*note: you may need to start ssh-agent in the background for this, if the above doesn't work, type `ssh-agent /bin/bash` to git bash first*

### 2.4 Add SSH public key to GitHub

Go to your `.ssh` directory (it's likely hidden). Copy your SSH public key file to your clipboard. The file should have the `.pub` file extension. **DON'T COPY YOUR PRIVATE KEY**. On the upper right corner of your GitHub web page, click your profile picture and go to your GitHub account `Settings`. In the `Access` section of the sidebar, click `SSH and GPG keys`. Click `New SSH Key` or `Add SSH key`. Add a descriptive label in the 'Title' for this new key, for example, 'Work Computer'. Choose `Authentication Key`. Paste your public key to the `Key` field. Click `Add SSH keyu`.


### 2.5 Test Connection

Open Git Bash and type the following.
```
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If successful, you will be prompted to type your passphrase and a successful authentication response will be given.

## 3. Cloning Repo

Go to the GitHub repo you want to clone. Click `Code` and choose the `SSH` tab. Copy the `.git` URL. Open Git Bash to the directory you want to clone the repo in and type the following, replacing the URL with the one you just copied.
```
git clone git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
```

## 4. Branches

GitHub allows you to put projects under version control. By 'cloning' a repository, we create two copies of the repository, a 'local' one on your laptop, and a 'remote' one on GitHub. The 'local' repo is your primary workspace where you can create, edit, and delete files. The 'remote' repo, in this case, is stored on GitHub where we can easily share our changes with collaborators. 

Each repo will have a `main` branch (called `master` on older git versions, we don't do that anymore), which should contain the merged 'clean' code. This branch will eventually be the branch the houses the production code. To work on issues and effectively collaborate on coding projects, we need to create a 'branch' from the main repo. Branching allows us to incrementally update the code base and make commits to features. Once a new feature is finished, we can then merge to the `main` branch. This separation of feature branches is what allows us to develop our code base in parallel where progress can be made on mulitple independent features simultaneously. 

To create a branch locally, open Git Bash and type the following.
```
git checkout -b branch_name
```
*note: branch names should be short and descriptive of the feature you're working on*

To switch branches you can type the following to Git Bash.
```
git switch new_branch
```
*note: you can also create a new branch by typeing `git switch -c branch_name`*

## 5. Add, Commit, Push, Pull, Pull Request

There are generally four additional steps you must take as part of your regular software collaborate workflow:

1. Commit your changes in your local repo
2. Send your new commits to the remote (GitHub) repo
3. Retrieve any new changes (that others made) from the remote (GitHub) repo 
4. Merge your commits to the main branch

### 5.1 Commit

Once you reached a point that you want Git to keep a record of the current version of your work, you need to 'commit' your changes. A prerequisite to this is telling Git which files you want to include in this commit. We call this step adding file to a 'staging area'.

In Git Bash, type `git add <filename>` to stage one file or `git add .` to stage all files with changes (usually the second option is the way to go, makes sure you're not missing anything). To see which files are staged, you can type `git status`.

After the files have been staged, you are now ready to commit the changes to your local repo. Type `git commit -m "my new feature"`. You are required to include an informative message to briefly describe the purpose of your commit. This is helpful to explain to your collaborators what changes you made (the most common collaborator is your future self so be descriptive, you will forget what you did 4 months ago).

### 5.2 Push

Once you have made one or more commits that you want to share with everyone, you need to 'push' (i.e., upload to GitHub) those changes to the remote repo. This 'push' action will update the history in the remote repo to match your local repo. Now when collaborators interact with the remote repo, they will be able to see the changes you made. If you cloned a GitHub repo correctly, git knows that you want to push changes to GitHub so you can just type `git push`.

### 5.3 Pull

Changes pushed by collaborators will not be automatically added to your local repo. They will exist in the remote so it is your job to 'pull' those changes to your local repo so you can see them. To do this, just type `git pull`

### 5.4 Pull Request

A 'pull request' is a proposed merge of your changes. This step allows collaborators to review and discuss your proposed changes before it is merged into the main branch. You can create a pull request on GitHub after you 'push' the commit. This will initiate a review process, and if your changes are acceptable, the reviewer can then initial a 'merge' of the pull request which will merge the feature branch changes to the main branch.
